content.py - Quiz Application Entry Point

This module serves as the main entry point for the Traity Quiz application.
It initializes the PyQt5 application environment and launches the main quiz
interface.

Key Features:
- Application lifecycle management
- GUI application initialization
- Main window creation and display
- System exit handling

Architecture:
- Uses PyQt5 QApplication for GUI framework
- Imports and instantiates the main QuizApp class
- Follows standard PyQt application pattern

Development Notes:
- This is the file to run to start the quiz application
- Handles command-line arguments through sys.argv
- Ensures proper application shutdown with sys.exit()
- Contains development comments for future enhancements

Future Enhancements (from development comments):
- Enhanced navigation system with Previous/Next buttons ✓
- Answer validation with color-coded feedback (red/green) ✓
- Custom application icon support ✓
- Additional UI improvements and features

Usage:
    Run this file directly to start the quiz application:
    python content.py

    Main Application Entry Point
    
    This block executes when the script is run directly, setting up
    the complete PyQt5 application environment and launching the quiz.
    
    Process:
    1. Create QApplication instance with command-line arguments
    2. Instantiate the main QuizApp window
    3. Display the application window
    4. Enter the application event loop
    5. Exit cleanly when application closes
    
    The QApplication.exec_() method starts the Qt event loop which
    handles user interactions, window events, and keeps the GUI responsive.
